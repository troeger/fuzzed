Installation instructions for development machine 
==================================================
This project uses Python 2.7 and Fabric for installing software dependencies and managing the build process.

In order to install Fabric, please run 'easy_install fabric' or 'pip install fabric' to get it. 
This demands a working C compiler (gcc), Python header files (python-dev), pip / distutils (python-pip) and sudo being installed. All of this is given anyway on a reasonable Linux box.

Make sure to check the supported Fabric tasks with 'fab -l'.

Preparation of development machine
-----------------------------------
> fab bootstrap_dev

Compile static stuff and prepare SQLite database
------------------------------------------------
> fab build
> ./manage.py syncdb
> ./manage.py migrate

Run development web server and backend servers
----------------------------------------------
> ./manage.py runbackend
> ./manage.py runserver

Create install packages in ./dist on developer machine
-------------------------------------------------------
> fab build
> fab package

Some thoughts
=============
Fabric is used for:

- Avoiding distutils for Make-alike tasks, which must be all done in the 'build' step.
- Avoiding the need for a private repository when software installation is done with Puppet.
  We just push the release explicitely.
- Avoiding the handling of initscript installation, database setup a.s.o. in such a software 
  install package. Generating correct DEB files is very hard. 

Cuisine is used for:

- Easier (mostly OS-agnostic) management of software dependencies on development and production machine.
  Doing this as part of a generated software install package (e.g. DEB) or through explicit Fabric commands would make the solution very OS-specific, and would not solve the dev machine problem. Vagrant is also not solving the dev machine problem, is still needs a software dependency description.
