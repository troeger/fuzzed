Installation of development machine
===================================

A development machine needs sudo, gcc, Python 2.7 + header files, pip, and Fabric (from PyPI) as minimum starting point. 
You can install them directly, or use Vagrant to create a Virtual Machine with them from our Vagrantfile.

Running Vagrant for a dev VM
----------------------------
1. Install Vagrant from http://downloads.vagrantup.com/
2. Install VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
3. Run vagrant up
4. Once the provisioning script has run through, you can run vagrant ssh
5. cd /home/fuzztrees
6. fab -l

Edit the Vagrantfile in order to get graphical mode: uncomment
#config.vm.boot_mode = :gui

Install all software dependencies, create the database
------------------------------------------------------
> fab bootstrap_dev

Developing for FuzzEd
=====================

Compile static stuff and create sync database tables
----------------------------------------------------
> fab build.all
> ./manage.py syncdb --migrate

Run development web server
--------------------------
> ./manage.py runserver

Run backend services
--------------------
> fab run.backend

Writing tests for FuzzEd
========================
> fab fixture_save:testgraphs.json

Saves a new fixture file from the current database. It can be referenced
in the unit tests stored in tests.py.

> fab fixture_load:testgraphs.json

Overwrites the current database with the test fixture. This allows local
editing of the test database with the editor, which can than be saved again.

> fab run_tests

Run all tests stored in tests.py.
